The goal of the project is to tell the story of the Maidan by the means of understandable
and beautiful vizualisations. I often find myself in trouble of recalling the main events
and putting them into the logical order. Having them nicely organized will as well help others to
understand the events better.

Current vision is to organize all important media content (videos, images, pictures, etc)
related to the Maidan and present it:
* in a chronological using timeline.js
* location-based using storymap.js or a map with nice interactive markers (leaflet.js)

On the first iteration the events data will be stored in a Google Doc.
To allow crowdsourcing of the data a form will be created and distirbuted via facebook.
The Google Doc will be moderated if needed and will be openly published.
