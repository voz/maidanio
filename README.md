The goal of the project is to tell the story of the Maidan by the means of understandable
and beautiful vizualisations.

I often find it hard to recall the main events and putt them into the logical order.
Having the events/places/people nicely organized would help me and others to
understand the Maidan events better.

The current vision is to organize all important media content (videos, images, pictures, etc)
related to the Maidan and present it:
* in a chronological order using the timeline.js library
* location-based using the storymap.js library or a map with nice interactive markers (leaflet.js)

To allow crowdsourcing of the data a Google Form will be created and distirbuted via facebook.
The events data will be stored in a Google Doc and will be moderated if needed. The data will
be published online.
